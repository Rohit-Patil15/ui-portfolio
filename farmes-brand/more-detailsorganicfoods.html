    <h2>Health Benefits of Organic</h2>
    <p>Organic products reduce public health risks to farm workers, their families, and consumers by minimizing their
        exposure to toxic and persistent chemicals on the farm and in food, the soil in which they work and play, the
        air they breathe, and the water they drink. Children are especially vulnerable to pesticides. Thus, offering
        organic food and fiber products into the marketplace gives parents the option of choosing products produced
        without the use of these toxins
        Not only does organic production help reduce public health risks, mounting evidence shows that food grown
        organically are rich in nutrients, such as Vitamin C, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus, with less exposure to
        nitrates and pesticide residues in organically grown fruits, vegetables, and grains when compared to
        conventionally grown products.
        While proving health benefits of eating a particular food is a complex question to answer, evidence is mounting
        that there are some healthier nutritional profiles linked to consuming various organic products. For instance, a
        research article published in December 2013 in PLOS ONE found that organic whole milk contained significantly
        higher concentrations of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids compared to milk from cows raised on conventionally
        managed dairy farms. Meanwhile, a research article published in the journal Food Chemistry found organic
        soybeans have a healthier nutritional profile from conventionally grown or genetically modified Roundup Ready
        soybeans.</p>
