        <h1>Fruits</h1>
        <p>
            A fruit is a seed-bearing structure that develops from the ovary of a flowering plant post-fertilisation in
            sexually reproducing plants. After the process of fertilisation, usually all the parts of a flower wither
            away,
            except for the ovary and the ovules which mature into the fruits and the seeds, respectively. The fruits'
            main
            purpose is not merely to nourish you or please your palate. Yes! The main purpose of a fruit is to protect
            the
            seeds they enclose. In fact, in certain plants fruits can be inedible, unappealing or too little to be used
            as
            food. However, some fruit varieties such as bananas and grapes may not have seeds. These fruits are
            parthenocarpic, or seedless fruits. Fruits of different plants can vary in shapes, colours, taste, texture,
            nutritional value and even in longevity. Now let's take a closer look at the various parts of a fruit.

        <h3>Parts of fruit</h3>
        <p>
            Fruit has two parts, pericarp and the seed. Seed is the developed ovule. Pericarp is the ripened ovary wall.
            This pericarp could be thin and delicate, thin and rigid, or thick and meaty. Pericarp (fruit wall) is
            differentiated into 3 layers:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Epicarp -outermost wall / Skin</li>
            <li>Mesocarp - middle layer, tissue between epicarp and endocarp</li>
            <li>Endocarp - innermost layer, Covering of the seed</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="../public/images/fleshyfruit-berry.jpg">
        <p>
            However, the ovarian wall does not always develop into a juicy, delicious fruit like that in a peach or a
            mango. For instance, it turns into a dry, brittle protective pod in kidney beans.

        <h3>Types of fruits</h3>
        <h6>True fruits - These fruits usually develop from a mature ovary. Example: mango, coconut, grapes</h6>
        <h6>False fruits - These fruits develop from parts of the flower other than the ovary, such as the thalamus in case of apple.</h6>
